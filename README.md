# The Metro Group Coding Challenge

Thanks for taking the Metro Group coding challenge! The purpose of this project is to learn more about you and your programming style. This challenge will require you to complete the project we have set up for you.

## What is the objective of this project?

The objective of this project is to create a cat tax calculator to help internet users easily pay their [cat tax](https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/cat-tax/#:~:text=A%20cat%20tax%20is%20a,Meow!). In this case, the amount of cat tax a user owes is a random number from 0 to 20. Once the random number is generated, the user can pay their tax by adding one cat image to the display at a time until they pay off the complete amount.
